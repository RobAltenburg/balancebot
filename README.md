# balancebot #

Code to operate a robot that can balance on two wheels similar to the Segway.

This is written for an Arduino controlling a Sparkfun SEN-09268 (IDG500 Gyroscope & ADXL335 Accelerometer)

This needs some tweaking of the parameters. In my testbed robot there was some noise making the 
motor controller chatter and misbehave.  One of these days, I'll need to rebuild the testbed.
